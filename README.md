# GMM Entropy-based Anomaly Detection



Gaussian mixture modeling is a generative probabilistic model that assumes that the observed data are generated from a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with a noise component refers to a finite mixture that includes an additional noise component to model the background noise or outliers in the data. 
Scrucca (2023) proposes an entropy-based approach for initial detection of noisy data to be used in an EM algorithm for estimation of Gaussian mixtures with a uniform noise component over the convex hull of the data.
